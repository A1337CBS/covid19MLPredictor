                ## How it works

                The plots were generated by estimating the parameters of a simple extended [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model_is_dynamic_in_three_senses) using MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) sampling following 
                the method by [Dehning et. al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01105). Estimations
                are done for Qatar by looking at daily confirmed cases. 
                The SIR model is extended to account for time delay of reporting, weekend effects and, change in infection transmission rates through government interventions and other major events.
                Although a significant part of the infected people do not get tested or reported because say, they are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms, this must be
                modelled because the number of daily cases put out by MoPH only account for those people that are tested and confirmed positive (see [Rizzo et. al.](https://covid-research.qcri.org/seir/SEIR_Autograd.pdf)).  

                The dataset used comes from the [Qatar Open Data Portal](https://www.data.gov.qa/explore/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-qatar/information/).
                We are constantly working on improving the model with additional information and assumptions. Meanwhile, as the model produces coarse estimations based on a very simplified model and noisy response data, i.e., daily confirmed cases, it should be interpreted with the confidence intervals and there
                is also no guarantee the estimations will materialize.      

                ## Updates
                - 16/5/2020 Added a tested compartment in the SIR model. It was found that untested infected people make a difference to the SIR model.
                - 15/5/2020 Changed data source from [John Hopkins University repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) to 
                [Qatar Open Data Portal](https://www.data.gov.qa/explore/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-qatar/information/). The pages here will be
                updated with new data every noon and models will be updated with a small delay.
