            ## How it works


            The plots were generated by estimating the parameters of a simple SIR model using MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) sampling. The estimations
            are done for the country of Qatar by looking at daily confirmed cases. 
            The SIR model is extended to account for time delay of reporting, weekend effects and, government interventions and other major events.
            
            As the model produces coarse estimations based on a very simplified model and noisy data, it should be interpreted with the confidence interval and there
            is no guarantee the estimations will materialize.
